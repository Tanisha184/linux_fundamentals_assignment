# Linux Fundamentals Assignment

Welcome to my Linux Fundamentals Assignment repository! This branch (`assignment-2`) contains my completed tasks for the assignment.

## Assignment Overview

This assignment covers essential Linux commands and operations related to file system navigation and management. It consists of two main tasks:

### Task 1: File System Navigation

In this task, I've demonstrated how to perform basic file system navigation operations using Linux commands. This includes listing the contents of directories (`ls`), changing directories (`cd`), and finding executable paths (`which`).

### Task 2: File and Directory Operations

This task focuses on file and directory operations, such as creating directories (`mkdir`), creating files (`touch`), copying files (`cp`), moving files (`mv`), and changing file permissions (`chmod`).
